The objective of this project is to develop a customizable Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture. This architecture comprises smaller sub-systems, including:
1. Control Unit
2. Instruction Register
3. General Purpose Registers (GPR)
4. Arithmetic & Logical Unit (ALU)
5. Program and Data Memory

The goal is to design a CISC architecture that allows for flexibility and customization through these key components.
